### Project Problem Statement

<hr>

In Kenya, transparency and accountability in county governance are often challenged by limited public access to budgetary, expenditure, and project data. Citizens lack a centralized platform to view, report, and track the allocation and utilization of county resources. This results in reduced public trust and challenges in holding county officials accountable for public funds and projects.
